## Why this exists

TMX is 25 years old. Every CAT tool produces it, but the Python ecosystem has no library that gives you typed, validated, round-trippable TMX without forcing you to think about XML internals. Hypomnema fixes that.

It is an **infrastructure library** — the pandas of TMX, if you will. It gives you a typed domain model you can reason about, operations you can compose, and backends you can swap. It does not validate your semantics (if your "English" variant contains French, that's your problem), but it does ensure structural validity: every node enforces its invariants at construction time, and unknown elements are preserved as opaque payloads rather than silently dropped.

What it is **not**: a segmentation engine, a corpus manager, an alignment tool, or an MT pipeline. Those are things you _build with_ Hypomnema, not things it does for you.

## Philosophy

**Dependency-free by default.** The standard library is all you need. `lxml` is an opt-in extra for performance. The aim is for this to stay true forever — optional dependencies for things like language-code validation may appear, but `pip install hypomnema` will always give you a working library with no transitive deps.

**Type safety is non-negotiable.** Everything passes `mypy --strict`. We lean hard on modern Python — generic syntax (`E` instead of `TypeVar`), `match`/`case`, union types as `X | Y`, `dataclass(frozen=True, slots=True)`. The floor is 3.13 and will probably become 3.14 before 1.0. There is no reason a new project should carry compatibility baggage for EOL Python releases.

**Round-trip fidelity.** Anything Hypomnema doesn't model explicitly is captured verbatim as `UnknownNode` / `UnknownInlineNode` payloads (raw bytes). Loading a TMX file and dumping it back produces structurally equivalent output regardless of which backend you pick.

**Backend parity.** `StandardBackend` and `LxmlBackend` are first-class citizens. They share all namespace logic through pure functions. Every test that touches a backend is parametrized over both. If one can do something the other can't, that's a bug.

```

The domain layer is the intermediate representation. Loaders convert serialized content into domain nodes. Dumpers convert domain nodes back into serialized content. Backends handle the low-level serialization details. Operations run on domain nodes and never touch XML.

This separation means you can add a JSON backend (for FastAPI interop), a CSV backend (for spreadsheet workflows), or a Polars backend (for dataframe-scale analysis) without touching a single line of the domain model. The domain is format-agnostic — it's an IR.

## Domain model

Every TMX element is a `dataclass(slots=True)` with two distinct attribute regions:

- **`spec_attributes`** — a separate slotted dataclass holding the fields defined by the TMX 1.4B specification. Typed, validated at construction, IDE-autocompletable.
- **`extra_attributes`** — a plain `dict[str, str]` for vendor extensions, non-standard attributes, or anything not in the spec. Preserved through round-trips.

This split makes it immediately obvious what's spec and what's vendor contamination. No guessing.

### Attribute renaming

TMX attribute names are mapped to readable Python. Hyphens aren't valid identifiers, and abbreviations hide intent:

| TMX attribute         | Domain name             | Notes                              |
| --------------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `creationdate`        | `created_at`            | `datetime` — not a string          |
| `changedate`          | `last_modified_at`      | `datetime`                         |
| `creationid`          | `created_by`            | It's a user, not an ID             |
| `changeid`            | `last_modified_by`      | Same                               |
| `creationtool`        | `creation_tool`         | Readable                           |
| `creationtoolversion` | `creation_tool_version` | Readable                           |
| `o-encoding`          | `original_encoding`     | Hyphens → underscores              |
| `o-tmf`               | `original_tm_format`    | Abbreviation expanded              |
| `srclang`             | `source_language`       | Readable                           |
| `adminlang`           | `admin_language`        | Readable                           |
| `segtype`             | `segmentation_type`     | Readable                           |
| `datatype`            | `original_data_type`    | It's "original data type" per spec |
| `tuid`                | `translation_unit_id`   | Readable                           |
| `usagecount`          | `usage_count`           | Underscore                         |
| `lastusagedate`       | `last_used_at`          | `datetime`                         |
| `version`             | `version`               | Kept as-is                         |
| `lang`                | `language`              | It's a language code               |

Datetime attributes (`created_at`, `last_modified_at`, `last_used_at`) are stored as `datetime` objects, not strings — they're parsed on load and formatted on dump. TMX recommends the `YYYYMMDDTHHMMSSZ` format so that's what Hypomnema dumps to by default.

> [!note]
> Hypomnema parses datetime via datetime.fromisoformat() and formats to YYYYMMDDTHHMMSSZ regardless of the original format. If you need a different output format, you'll need to override the dumpers for the relevant elements.

### Inline content

Segment content isn't a string — it's a mixed list of `str`, the allowed type of content node for that element (so `Sub` or `Bpt | Ept | It | Ph | Hi | Sub`) and `UnknownInlineNode`. This preserves markup structure so you can query, transform, and round-trip it.

> [!important]
> The structure of the TMX format means it can technically be infinitely recursive and Hypomnema is the same. Be careful when using recursion and infinite loops. For memory efficiency, Hypomnema uses a stack-based approach to recursion internally.

```python
for item in variant.segment:
  match item:
    case str():
      ...
    case Bpt(spec_attributes=a):
      print(a.internal_id)
    case UnknownInlineNode(payload=bytes):
      # preserved for round-trip, never touched
      ...
```

## Type safety

The entire codebase is `mypy --strict` clean. We use modern Python features throughout:

- **PEP 695 generics** — `XmlBackend[E]` instead of `XmlBackend(Generic[E])`, `XmlLoader[T]` instead of `TypeVar` boilerplate
- **`match`/`case`** — for namespace resolution (`namespace.py`), event dispatch in iterparse, and tag dispatch in loaders
- **Union types as `X | Y`** — no `Optional`, no `Union`
- **`dataclass(frozen=True, slots=True)`** — immutable, memory-efficient, hashable
- **Protocol-based backend contract** — `XmlBackendLike[E]` is a `Protocol` so you can mock it, proxy it, or implement it without inheriting. `XmlBackend[E]` is the shared ABC that both concrete backends inherit from.
- **NamedTuples for resolution results** — `ResolveResult(prefix, uri, localname, clark)` is explicit and typed, not a 4-tuple

The generic `E` parameter threads the element type through the entire stack — `XmlLoader[et.Element]` vs `XmlLoader[et._Element]` produce the same domain nodes but are statically distinguished at the backend layer.

## Xml Backend details

### Namespace handling

All namespace logic lives in pure functions in `namespace.py`. No class, no state — just functions that take maps and return results:

```text
resolve("ns:item", global_nsmap={...}, nsmap={...}) → ResolveResult
format_notation(result, "local", global_nsmap={...}) → str
register_namespace(nsmap, "ns", "http://...")  # mutates dict in-place
```

Resolution uses **successive lookups**: per-call `nsmap` first, then `global_nsmap`. No dict merging, no copies. The `xml` prefix is built-in and always maps to `http://www.w3.org/XML/1998/namespace`.

Clark notation (`{uri}local`) is the internal representation. Prefixed names and default-namespace names are resolved at the boundary. `format_notation` with `"prefixed"` raises `MultiplePrefixesError` if the URI maps to ambiguity in one map.

### LxmlBackend and element.nsmap

Lxml elements expose `element.nsmap` — in-scope namespace declarations. Methods that resolve names (`get_tag`, `get_attribute`, etc.) merge this into a fresh dict alongside the caller's `nsmap` for the resolution call. The caller's dict is never mutated.

### Streaming

`iterparse` yields elements whose closing tag is reached. Unmatched elements are cleared immediately to bound memory. `iterwrite` writes in batches with configurable buffer size, optional root wrapper, XML declaration, and doctype.

### Parsing

Both `parse()` methods use single-pass `iterparse` with `start` and `start-ns` events. `from_bytes` and `from_string` wrap the input in a `BytesIO`/`StringIO` and delegate to `parse()`. No double-scanning.

## What's not here yet

**Language code validation.** `lang` attributes are stored as strings. Proper BCP 47 validation would require an external dependency, which contradicts the zero-dep default. This will likely become an optional extra (`hypomnema[langcode]`) using `langcodes` or similar.

**`<map>` and `<ude>` tags.** These relate to custom character encodings and mapping tables. Supporting them properly would add significant complexity for negligible benefit since virtually no modern TMX file uses them. If broad demand emerges, they can be added.

**`<ut>` tag.** Will be modeled in a coming update.

**TMX versions other than 1.4B.** This is the de facto standard — every tool produces it, virtually no tool produces anything else. TMX 2.0 (which was only ever a Committee Draft) will be considered if it ever becomes real.

## Development

The project uses **uv** for everything — dependency management, virtual environments, testing, linting, type checking, publishing.

```bash
uv run pytest                  # run tests
uv run ruff check src/ tests/  # lint
uv run mypy --strict src/      # type check
```
